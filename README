the site api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest (as in Philipp Lackner's video) requires an access key.
the site defers to apilayer.com to get an access key, but the key won't work.
also, the exchange rates shown at
https://youtu.be/ct5etYgB5pQ?list=PLQkwcJG4YTCSSow0ulsj-kIc6drYG_D0E&t=1293
and can be copied from
https://github.com/philipplackner/CurrencyConverter/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
are different than those shown on exchangeratesapi.io
also, the Android Studio plugin that Philipp provided, namely JSON to Kotlin Class, won't do the
conversion after pasting the rates from exchangeratesapi.io
I can manually write the data classes so I won't have to use the plugin, but I'm not familiar with
and not sure if the rates can be converted as a Map in Retrofit
